# Lunar Lander Ai
I'm using Q learning to train an Ai to play lunar lander. In the game lunar lander, you have to land a robot between two flags on the moon.


## Installation


### Prerequisities
This project depends on the `swig` utility, which can be installed with your devices packet managers or at [the swig website](https://swig.org).


This project also depends on the `gymnasium`, `renderlab`, and `opencv-python` modules, which can be manually installed using `pip`.


Install the project using the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flippersteven/nvidia-final-submission
```


### Running 
Once installed you can open LunarLander.ipynb with jupyter lab and run all cells. The ai should begin training once the setup is complete. Videos of the ais performance will be made
available in the `./out` folder.
